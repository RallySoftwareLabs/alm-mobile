### To Do

- Modularize routes and have routes.coffee build itself from said modules
- Configure server per machine outside of GIT repo (ENV variables?) - Build dynamic index.html pushing config to client
- Search for artifacts
- Inline editing
- Allow logout
- Fix redirect to login page on failed WS call (conditional redirect on 401 in backbone_mods) I broke this in b479209d5b8eefa79dccdd5e3b202d1b3a7594e7

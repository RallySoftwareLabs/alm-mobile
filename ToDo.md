### To Do

- Modularize routes and have routes.coffee build itself from said modules
- Search for artifacts
- Inline editing
- Allow logout
- Fix redirect to login page on failed WS call (conditional redirect on 401 in backbone_mods) I broke this in b479209d5b8eefa79dccdd5e3b202d1b3a7594e7
- Remember which home page tab we were on when we come back
- Update ScheduleState field view
- Turn Blocked/Ready from nav items into wells
